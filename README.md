<strong>culegooner</strong> - Their tutorial on ASM taught me how to replace class files from vanilla Minecraft and other mods using ASM. (https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/mapping-and-modding-tutorials/1571568-tutorial-1-6-2-changing-vanilla-without-editing). Additionally, some of the source code for his mod "Creeper Burn Core" was used to implement ASM methods in this mod (see link to the Creeper Burn Core source code below).
